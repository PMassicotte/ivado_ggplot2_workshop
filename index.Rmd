# Data visualization

- Important aspect of data sciences -> Communicate information clearly and efficiently to the community.

- Powerful tool to discovers patterns in the data.

- It makes complex data more accessible -> **reveal data**.

- Bad graphics can be a reason for paper rejection!
    * <span class="gradient-underline">Readers should rapidly understand the message you are trying to convey.</span>

- A picture is worth a thousand words.
    * <span class="gradient-underline">Always, always, always plot your data!</span>
    * When possible, replace tables with more compelling figures.

# Different types of visualizations

There are many types of visualization to chose from to present data. The decision depends on the data itself and how you want to present it to your audience.

# TidyTuesday

TidyTuesday is a weekly challenge where people use (mostly) `ggplot2` to explore a new dataset.

> A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem.

# Let's start with ggplot2!

---

# The data

For the following examples, we are going to use the data from the `mpg` dataset. This dataset contains a subset of the [fuel economy data](http://fueleconomy.gov) from the EPA. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mpg %>%
  head(50) %>% 
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

---

# The data

It should be noted that `ggplot2` package operates on R `dataframes`.

```{r}
str(mpg)
```

---

# Understanding the ggplot2 syntax

A `ggplot2` plot is built layer by layer by using the `+` operator.

# The geoms 

`geoms` is the abbreviation for *geometric objects* which are used to specify which type of graphic you want to produce (boxplot, barplot, scatter, ...). All `ggplot2` geoms start with `geom_`.

<small>
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ls(pattern = "^geom_", env = as.environment("package:ggplot2"))
```

# One variable graphics

In this section, we are going to see the two main types of one variable graphics:

| **Graphic type** | **Geom**           | **Description**                          |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Histogram        | `geom_histogram()` | Produces histograms for continuous data. |
| Barplot          | `geom_bar()`       | Produces histograms for discrete data.   |


```{r histogram1, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = mpg,
  mapping = aes(x = cty)
) +
  geom_histogram()
```

---

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "histogram1", title = "# Histogram")`

---

```{r barplot1, include=FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = mpg,
  mapping = aes(x = class)
) +
  geom_bar()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "barplot1", title = "# Barplot")`

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Two variables graphics

# Two variables graphics

There are several types of charts with two variables. Here are the three types mostly used.

| **Graphic type** | **Geom**         | **Description**                            |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Scatter plot     | `geom_point()`   | Produces scatter plot between `x` and `y`. |
| Line plot        | `geom_line()`    | Produces line plot between `x` and `y`.    |
| Boxplot          | `geom_boxplot()` | Boxplot between `x` and `y`.               |

---

```{r scatterplot1, include = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "scatterplot1", title = "# Scatter plot")`

---

```{r lineplot1, include = FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_line()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "lineplot1", title = "# Line plot")`

---

# Boxplot

> In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot is a convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles (Wikipedia).

To make a boxplot, we need to have a **discrete/categorical** variable on `x` and a **continuous** variable on `y`.

---

```{r boxplot1, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = mpg,
  mapping = aes(x = class, y = cty)
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "boxplot1", title = "# Boxplot")`

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Geom aesthetics

---

# Geom aesthetics

Aesthetics such as *color*, *shape*, *size* of the displayed geoms can be controlled inside the `geom_()` functions. 

For example, we can change the *color* and the *size* of the point in the `geom_point()` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
geom_point(color = "red", size = 10)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width=6}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty)) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 10)
```

---

# Working with colors

If we want to set a specific color, we have to set it outside the aesthetic: `geom_point(color = "orange")`.

```{r, fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(color = "orange") #<<
```

---

# Working with colors

If we want to set a color based on a variable, we have to use the aesthetic: `aes(colour = variable)`.

```{r, fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) #<<
```

---

# Working with size

In the same manner, the size of the dots can be based on a particular variable.

```{r, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = cyl)) #<<
```

---

# Setting colors manually

By default, `ggplot2` will use a default color palette.

```{r, fig.height = 3.5}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv))

p
```

---

```{r manual_colors1, include = FALSE}
p +
  scale_color_manual(
    breaks = c("4", "f", "r"),
    values = c(
      "orange",
      "#CB2955",
      "blue"
    ),
    labels = c(
      "Front wheel drive",
      "Rear wheel drive",
      "4wd"
    )
  )
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "manual_colors1", title = "# Setting colors manually \n We can also create our own palette of colors using *scale_color_manual()*.")`

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Axes and titles

---

# Axes and titles

There are many ways to change the titles of the graphic and the axes. Here we are going to use the `labs()` function. 

These are the main parameters:

- `title`: Main title of the graph

- `x`, `y`: Titles for the axes

- `subtitle`: Subtitle title of the graph

- `caption`: Caption of the graph

---

```{r, axes_and_titles1, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  mpg,
  aes(x = displ, y = cty)
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Car fuel economy",
    subtitle = "Data from 1999 to 2008 for 38 popular models of cars",
    caption = "Data from: https://fueleconomy.gov/",
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "City miles per gallon"
  )
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "axes_and_titles1", title = "# Axes and titles")`

---

```{r, axes_and_titles2, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  mpg,
  aes(x = displ, y = cty)
) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(3, 6),
    labels = c("Three", "Six")
  )
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "axes_and_titles2", title = "# Controling axis labels")`

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Faceting

---

# Faceting

Faceting is a technique that allows displaying additional categorical variables in facets. Within `ggplot2`, there are two types of faceting: `facet_grid()` and `facet_wrap()`.

---

```{r, facet1, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  mpg,
  aes(x = displ, y = cty)
) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~class)
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "facet1", title = "# 1D faceting")`

---

```{r, facet2, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  mpg,
  aes(x = displ, y = cty)
) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~class, scales = "free")
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "facet2", title = "# 1D faceting")`

---

```{r, facet3, include = FALSE}
ggplot(
  mpg,
  aes(x = cty)
) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(cyl ~ class)
```

`r chunk_reveal(chunk_name = "facet3", title = "# 2D faceting")`

---

# Saving your graphics

Saving `ggplot2` graphics is done with the `ggsave()` function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = cty)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Vector formats**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggsave("path/to/myfile.pdf", p, width = 5.97, height = 4.79)
ggsave("path/to/myfile.eps", p, width = 5.97, height = 4.79)
ggsave("path/to/myfile.ps", p, width = 5.97, height = 4.79)
```

**Raster formats**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggsave("path/to/myfile.jpg", p, width = 5.97, height = 4.79, dpi = 300)
ggsave("path/to/myfile.tiff", p, width = 5.97, height = 4.79, dpi = 300)
ggsave("path/to/myfile.png", p, width = 5.97, height = 4.79, dpi = 300)
```

# Using ggplot2 themes

# `ggplot2` themes

> Themes are a powerful way to customize the non-data components of your plots: i.e. titles, labels, fonts, background, gridlines, and legends.

Many components can be changed using the `theme()` function. Today we are going to see just a few of them, but feel free to have a look at `?theme` to have more information.

# Combining plots

It is often useful to combine plots and many R packages can do it. Here we are going to have a quick overview of the `patchwork` package. The package is not part of base R so it needs to be installed and loaded before you can use it.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("patchwork")

library(patchwork)
```

# Combining plots

First, let's make some plots. We are going to use a dataset about [alcohol use by country](https://datahub.io/five-thirty-eight/alcohol-consumption/r/0.html). It is a dataset containing 193 rows and 5 columns. Here is a preview of the data.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- read_csv(here::here("data", "raw", "drinks_csv.csv"))

df %>%
  rmarkdown::paged_table()
```

---

# Overview of the data

The data description is as follows:

- `country`: Name of the country

- `beer_servings`: Average number of beer servings per capita

- `spirit_servings`: 	Average number of spirit servings per capita

- `wine_servings`: 	Average number of wine servings per capita

- `total_litres_of_pure_alcohol`: Average quantity of pure alcohol consumed per capita 

---

# Lets make a plot

This graph shows the top 10 countries with the highest average quantity of pure alcohol consumed.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df_viz <- df %>%
  top_n(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, n = 10) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    -c(country, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol),
    names_to = "serving_type",
    values_to = "serving_quantity"
  )
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p1 <- df_viz %>%
  mutate(
    country = fct_reorder(country, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, y = country)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    x = "Average quantity of pure alcohol\nconsumed per capita (liters)",
    y = NULL
  )
```

```{r}
p1
```

---

# Lets make another plot

This graph shows the type of servings for the top 10 countries with the highest average quantity of pure alcohol consumed.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p2 <- df_viz %>%
  mutate(
    country = fct_reorder(country, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = serving_quantity, y = country, fill = serving_type)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    x = "Average number of servings",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(
    breaks = c("beer_servings", "spirit_servings", "wine_servings"),
    labels = c("Beer", "Spirit", "Wine")
  ) +
  theme(
    legend.title = element_blank()
  )
```

```{r}
p2
```

---

# Combining horizontally

```{r, fig.width = 10}
p1 + p2
```

---

# Combining vertically

```{r, fig.width = 7}
p1 / p2
```

---

# More complex arrangement

```{r, fig.width = 10, out.width="100%"}
(p1 + p2) / p1
```

---

# Adding labels

It is often necessary to identify each panel (graph) with a letter. This can be achieved with the `plot_annotation()`.

```{r, fig.width = 7}
p1 / p2 +
  plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A") #<<
```

---

# A final note...

There is a lot to learn about `ggplot2` and data visualization, but I hope you have learned something today.

If it is not the case...
